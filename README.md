# Social Media App Documentation

## Overview

The Social Media App is a simple RESTful API application that allows users to create posts, like posts, and follow other users. The application is built using Spring Boot and uses PostgresSQL database for persistence.

## Database Configuration

The application uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. The database configuration is specified in the `application.properties` file:
```properties
# Postgres
spring.datasource.url=${POSTGRES_HOST_URL}/social_media_db
spring.datasource.username=${POSTGRES_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Hibernate ddl auto (create, create-drop, validate, update)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
```

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eshonkulov-asliddin/socia-media-app.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd socia-media-app  
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Running Tests and Generating Code Coverage Report
You can run the tests and generate the code coverage report with the following command:
```bash
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```
The code coverage report is saved in the build/reports/jacoco/test directory.

## Running SonarQube Analysis (Optional)

If you have SonarQube installed, you can run the SonarQube analysis with the following command:
```bash
./gradlew sonarqube
```

## Quality Checks
The project includes unit tests with a code coverage of over 80%. The code quality is checked using SonarQube, which checks the code coverage, complexity, and coding style.

# Feedback
- **Was it easy to complete the task using AI?**  
  Yes, the AI was able to provide accurate and helpful responses that made it easier to complete the task.

- **How long did task take you to complete?**  
  The task took approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

- **Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?**  
  The code generated by the AI was mostly ready to run. I only had to make a few minor adjustments to fit my specific use case.

- **Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?**  
  The main challenge was understanding how to properly configure SonarQube and JaCoCo for code coverage analysis. The AI was able to provide clear instructions on how to do this.

- **Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?**  
  I learned that it's a good practice to use environment variables to store sensitive information like the SonarQube token. This keeps the sensitive information out of the code and makes it easier to change the values without having to modify the code.
